# Pirate Islands — hotseat prototype

A throwaway digital prototype of the Pirate Islands board game, for playtesting, at rules v0.2:
coloured treasure from a bag, first to 5 of one colour. 3–5 seats share one screen, secretly pick
islands one at a time, then watch the reveal. Any seat can be a **bot**
(Greedy, Sneaky or Wild), so one person can play alone; the pass-the-device screen only appears
when 2+ humans are seated.

- **Everything is `index.html`.** Plain JS, no build, no dependencies. Open it in a browser.
- **Rule numbers live in the `RULES` block** at the top of the script. A variant is a one-line edit.
- **Bot tuning lives in the `BOTS` block** beside it. Bots read only public info (island piles, hauls,
  last round's picks), never this round's locks or the bag, and never change the rules.
- **Keep it tiny and readable.** Fewer lines over cleverness. No framework, no tests, no tooling
  unless a playtest proves it's needed.

## Where the planning lives

Not here. Design and rules are in the Obsidian vault at `~/code/vault`:

- Rules (source of truth): `Games/Pirate Islands/Pirate Islands - Rules.md`
- Game note and playtest log: `Games/Pirate Islands/Pirate Islands.md`
- Wayfinder maps and tickets: `Projects/Pirate Islands Digital/PI Map.md` (v0.1), `Projects/Pirate Islands v0.2/PI2 Map.md` (v0.2)

Never invent a rule. If the build needs one the rules don't give, ask Alex and record it in the
vault rules.
